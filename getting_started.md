# Getting started

Depending on what you want to do, you should look at one of the following pages.

I want to use roviz with the existing items:

[How to use roviz](howto/use)

I want to create my own items for roviz:

[How to write plugins](howto/plugins)

I want to create a stream to transport my own data from one item to another:

[What streams are and how to create your own](howto/streams)

I want to create my own backend:

[What backends are and how to create your own](howto/backends)

I want to contribute to roviz and need more insight on the internals of
roviz:

[More about the internals of roviz](howto/core)
